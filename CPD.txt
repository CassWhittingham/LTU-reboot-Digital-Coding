Reflection

In todays lesson we looked again at Github and how to clone the file. 

It was nice to be able to talk through problems and brainstorm them with the class to resolution.

We looked at VS Code which I've used briefly before but I'm looking forward to learning how to use this in

more detail so I can be more independent.
