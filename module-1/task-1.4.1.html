Reflection

In todays lesson we looked again at Github and how to clone the file. 

It was nice to be able to talk through problems and brainstorm them with the class to resolution.

We looked at VS Code which I've used briefly before but I'm looking forward to learning how to use this in

more detail so I can be more independent.

Reflection

Homework was set for today. First task is to update the txt file for our learning.

I think that I'm ok doing this today and then I will feel more confident as we do this task
more often actually in the lessons.

I have downloaded SoloLearn to my mobile and will have a look at that. 

I thought todays lesson went really well and its nice to hear the relation to every day work - so 
the tasks that we did today in learning a bit more about how to do this updating the txt file and commiting 
to Github is something that junior devs learn - so I can see my progress a bit more!
