    <h1>1.3 - 30-09-2020</h1> <!--h1 is a heading with the highest importance-->

<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>In todays lesson we looked again at Github and how to clone the file. 

    It was nice to be able to talk through problems and brainstorm them with the class to resolution.</p>

<p>We looked at VS Code which I've used briefly before but I'm looking forward to learning how to use this in

    more detail so I can be more independent.</p>

<p>1.3.1 - 30-09-2020

Reflection

Homework was set for today. First task is to update the txt file for our learning.

I think that I'm ok doing this today and then I will feel more confident as we do this task
more often actually in the lessons.

I have downloaded SoloLearn to my mobile and will have a look at that. 

I thought todays lesson went really well and its nice to hear the relation to every day work - so 
the tasks that we did today in learning a bit more about how to do this updating the txt file and commiting 
to Github is something that junior devs learn - so I can see my progress a bit more!</p> 

<h1>Reflection 01-10-2020</h1>

<p>Today we learnt about how to add header and paragraphs into the html - so 
    to start with we added a html opener and body element to our cpd document.
    
    we went through how to commit those changes again and learnt how to create a new
    branch so that we weren't always working on master.</p>

<p>we learnt how to add a comment into the code which is a different way to
    how I added comments many years ago!</p>

<p>Also good was using the live server to see what the copy looks like live.
    Really important to remember to end live feed - bottom of the screen select 
    port and disconnect.
    
    We created the html index file so we could also see layout on live via the 
    github browser settings</p>

<p>Two videos to watch today to understand a little more about CSS and Javascript and HTML</p>

<h1>Reflection 05-10-2020</h1>
<p>Today we did more about headers and paragraphs but we also learnt about emphasis and strong</p>
<p>adding emphasis will make the content italic and making the content strong will turn it bold</p>
<p>We very quickly learnt how to add a link into the content also and how to open that link in a new browser tab.
    Also, we created our own doctype header - we've done this before but we used a shortcut. Today we added it manually also.
</p>

<h1>Reflection 06-10-2020</h1>
<p>We learnt how to create a list using bullet points (unordered) and numbers (ordered). We can also create a table if we wanted. 
    Completed tasks 2.1.4 through to 2.2.2. which helped us to open tabs in new tab, same tab and open default email programme.
    We also started to play around with CSS so had to create a style folder and style css document and link it to the html file. 
    More going over adding the document header where it is possible to create the link to the css file.
    I went a little wrong on the 'go live' but trouble shooting this with Julie highlighted where I'd gone wrong - I hadn't highlighted the 
    folder that I wanted to make live.
    We also learnt how to add an image into the page - task 2.1.5 and how to use css to re-size them nicely

</p>

<h1>Reflection 07-10-2020</h1>
<p>Today we talked more about how to create borders, how text and images was in blocks and what took up more space.
    We learnt to hightlight words/text and to add more emphasis using css and creating tags, header and class types.
    We can change colors of differents words in a paragraph and also pick out the same word or class in different paragraphs so they are actually
    the same colour
